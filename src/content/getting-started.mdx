# Getting Started

Welcome to CasDoc! This guide will help you get up and running with CasDoc quickly so you can start improving your documentation with AI-powered polishing and translation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Go 1.19 or later**: CasDoc is written in Go and requires a recent version
- **OpenAI API Key**: You'll need access to OpenAI's API for AI-powered features
- **Git**: For cloning the repository and managing your documentation projects

## Quick Setup

### 1. Get an OpenAI API Token

First, you'll need an OpenAI API token:

1. Visit [OpenAI's API platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in to your account or create a new one
3. Navigate to "API Keys" in your dashboard
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Copy your API key (keep it secure!)

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Set up the required environment variables:

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API token
export CASDOC_AUTHTOKEN=your_openai_api_key_here

# Set the path to your documentation repository
export CASDOC_REPOPATH=/path/to/your/documentation/repo
```

**Important**: Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key, and set `CASDOC_REPOPATH` to the path containing your documentation files.

### 3. Install CasDoc

#### Option A: Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/casbin/casdoc.git
cd casdoc

# Build the application
go build

# Run CasDoc
./casdoc
```

#### Option B: Use Go Install

```bash
# Install directly with Go
go install github.com/casbin/casdoc@latest

# Run CasDoc
casdoc
```

#### Option C: Run with Go Run

```bash
# Clone and run directly
git clone https://github.com/casbin/casdoc.git
cd casdoc
go run main.go
```

## Your First Documentation Polish

Let's polish some documentation:

### 1. Prepare Your Documentation

Ensure your documentation is in a `docs/` directory within your repository:

```
your-repo/
├── docs/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── guide.md
│   └── api.md
└── other-files...
```

### 2. Run CasDoc

With your environment variables set, run CasDoc:

```bash
# Navigate to your documentation repository
cd /path/to/your/repo

# Run CasDoc to polish all documentation
casdoc
```

CasDoc will:
- Scan your `docs/` directory
- Process each markdown file
- Use AI to improve clarity, grammar, and style
- Show progress as it works through your files

### 3. Review the Results

After CasDoc completes:
- Check the improved documentation files
- Review the changes for accuracy
- Commit the improvements to your repository
