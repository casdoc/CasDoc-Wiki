# Core Concepts

Understanding these fundamental concepts will help you use CasDoc effectively and take full advantage of its capabilities.

## Document Traceability

**Traceability** is the ability to trace relationships between different parts of your documentation. In CasDoc, this means:

- **Forward Traceability**: From requirements to implementation to testing
- **Backward Traceability**: From tests back to requirements
- **Bi-directional Links**: Relationships that work in both directions

### Why Traceability Matters

- **Impact Analysis**: Understand what changes when requirements evolve
- **Coverage Analysis**: Ensure all requirements are implemented and tested
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for documentation
- **Quality Assurance**: Verify completeness of your documentation

## Document Structure Visualization

CasDoc helps you visualize the structure of your documents through:

### Hierarchical Organization
- Documents are organized in a tree-like structure
- Clear parent-child relationships between sections
- Visual indicators of document depth and complexity

### Cross-Reference Networks
- Visual representation of links between different sections
- Dependency graphs showing relationships
- Impact visualization when changes are made

### Template Relationships
- How different templates relate to each other
- Standard patterns for common documentation workflows
- Consistency across similar document types

## Templates and Components

### What are Templates?

Templates are pre-structured content blocks that provide:
- **Consistent Format**: Standardized layouts for specific content types
- **Required Fields**: Ensure all necessary information is captured
- **Guided Creation**: Help users create complete documentation
- **Quality Assurance**: Reduce errors through structured input

### Template Categories

#### Requirements Templates
- **User Stories**: Agile development requirements
- **Use Cases**: Detailed functional requirements
- **Requirements Specifications**: Formal requirement documents

#### Testing Templates
- **Test Cases**: Individual test scenarios
- **Test Plans**: Comprehensive testing strategies
- **Test Reports**: Results and analysis

#### Technical Templates
- **API Documentation**: Interface specifications
- **Architecture Diagrams**: System design documentation
- **Data Schemas**: Data structure definitions

#### Process Templates
- **Procedures**: Step-by-step processes
- **Checklists**: Verification and validation lists
- **Workflows**: Process flow documentation

## Content Relationships

### Types of Relationships

#### **Implements**
- Links requirements to implementation details
- Shows what code or features fulfill specific requirements

#### **Tests**
- Connects test cases to requirements or implementations
- Ensures comprehensive test coverage

#### **Depends On**
- Shows dependencies between different components
- Helps with impact analysis and planning

#### **Refines**
- Links high-level requirements to detailed specifications
- Shows progressive elaboration of requirements

#### **Conflicts With**
- Identifies potential conflicts between requirements
- Helps resolve contradictions early

### Managing Relationships

- **Automatic Detection**: CasDoc can automatically detect some relationships
- **Manual Linking**: Create explicit links between related content
- **Relationship Types**: Choose appropriate relationship types
- **Validation**: Check for broken or inconsistent relationships

## Document Lifecycle

### Creation Phase
1. **Planning**: Define document structure and requirements
2. **Template Selection**: Choose appropriate templates
3. **Content Creation**: Fill in templates and add custom content
4. **Initial Review**: Basic quality checks

### Collaboration Phase
1. **Sharing**: Invite collaborators and set permissions
2. **Concurrent Editing**: Multiple users working simultaneously
3. **Comments and Feedback**: Built-in review and discussion tools
4. **Version Management**: Track changes and manage versions

### Maintenance Phase
1. **Updates**: Modify content as requirements change
2. **Impact Analysis**: Understand effects of changes
3. **Re-validation**: Ensure relationships remain valid
4. **Archive/Retire**: Manage obsolete documentation

## Quality Assurance

### Built-in Quality Checks

- **Completeness**: Ensure all required fields are filled
- **Consistency**: Check for formatting and terminology consistency
- **Validity**: Verify that relationships make sense
- **Compliance**: Meet organizational or regulatory standards

### Best Practices

- **Regular Reviews**: Schedule periodic documentation reviews
- **Peer Review**: Have others review your documentation
- **Tool Validation**: Use CasDoc's built-in validation features
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from feedback and improve processes
