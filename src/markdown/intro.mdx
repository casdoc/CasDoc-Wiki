> CasDoc is a docs-editing tool that enhances traceability through document structure visualization.

## Getting Started

### [**Fundamental Elements**](./fundamental-elements)

CasDoc is designed to help you **visualize document structures** into a "tree structure (aka mind map)" and **establish traceability**. To get familiar with CasDoc, we recommend first understanding the following three fundamental elements:

-   [**Template**](./fundamental-elements#templates): Visualize and manage document blocks.
-   [**Relation**](./fundamental-elements#relations): Record the impact relationships between elements.
-   [**Topic**](./fundamental-elements#topics): Organize elements into hierarchical categories.
